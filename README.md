Hats 
====

Platform game built in C# using the XNA framework.

<b>Hats</b> is a simple two dimensional platform game which incorporates a puzzle aspect creating a unique gameplay experience. The user or player interacts with the game through a set of two onscreen characters with the main aim of the game being to manipulate these characters to check points at the end of each level. 

During each level the player must traverse a series of puzzles to reach a checkpoint, with each puzzle only being passable after collection of a certain hat. Each hat, one located on each level, will enhance a particular attribute of the onscreen character, allowing the player to complete the puzzle. One of the major game play elements is the problem of how does the player get both characters through the puzzle when only one is able to wear a particular hat at a given time. Hats can be kept by the player through each level meaning the player will have to select the appropriate hat for the puzzle at hand. This could involve a combination of hats between the two playable characters.
